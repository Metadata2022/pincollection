## About the Collection

{% include feature/image.html objectid="coll011" width="75" %}

This lapel pin collection began on a whim of buying a pin to commemorate my first trip to St. Louis' famous Archway. Soon after, my habit of collecting lapel pins grew. My pins come in every shape and size. My favorite pins are ones that contain moving parts as seen in the picture above. These selected pins fall under two broad categories: 1) family summer/ spring break trips 2) school study abroad trips. 

Out of my family trips, the most memorable trip is our summer of caves. My family decided to stop at any "brown sign" or State Park sign on our way to visit my Grandpa in Tennessee. Our decision led to a summer of exploring caves. During a tour, the guide described the bats that called the cave their home as "furry chicken nuggets." Since hearing this description, I've always been reminded of the term. 

I collected a few pins during two study abroad exchanges in France and one college semester in China. These trips were school coordinated and ignited my love of languages. These few pins bring back memories of my classmates, language teachers, and exchange pin pals. These lapel pins span from cave exploring in Kentucky to a semester abroad in China. Each pin selected holds a special memory that now with this digital collection I can access and share anytime.
